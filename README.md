# Crabtrap Proxy

Crabtrap is an http proxy that can capture and replay requests.

It was originally developed to help with testing web crawlers in the [Crabfarm](http://www.crabfarm.io) project.

Features:

* Records SSL requests (using a self signed certificate).
* When in replay mode, it uses smart url/content matching to serve the proper response.
* Allows serving assets in a local folder at the crabtrap.io mock domain.

## Usage:

To record every passing requests, first start the proxy:

```
crabtrap capture ./somefile
```

then configure your browser's proxy to use `localhost:4000` and navigate.

When you are done, terminate the proxy process with Ctrl-C or TERM signal

To start replay mode use:

```
crabtrap replay ./somefile
```

The proxy will use the capture file to respond recorded requests (other requests will produce a 404 response)

To get more help on usage use

```
crabtrap -h
```
